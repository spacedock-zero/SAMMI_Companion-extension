# Quick Start Guide for the SAMMI Companion Extension

To get started with the SAMMI Companion Extension, follow these steps:
1. **Install SAMMI Companion**: 
   - Download and install the latest version of [SAMMI Companion](https://github.com/spacedock-zero/SAMMI-Companion_pre/releases) (follow the link to the latest release).
2. **Install the SAMMI Companion Extension**:
   - Download the latest version of the [SAMMI Companion Extension](https://github.com/spacedock-zero/SAMMI_Companion-extension/releases)
   - Open SAMMI
   - Click on "SAMMI Bridge" in the left sidebar
   - Then click "Install Extension" from the dropdown menu
   - Search for and select the downloaded "sammi-companion.sef" file and click "Open"

And that's it! The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

3. **Optionally Configure the Extension**:
  In SAMMI Bridge, you can configure the port in which the extension will connect to SAMMI Companion. By default, it uses port `19135`, but you can change it to match your Companion WebSocket settings if needed.

The Extension Version and the Companion App should match features and compatibility when the version numbers are the same. If you experience issues, make sure both the Extension and Companion App are up to date.
