# Quick Start Guide for the Companion SAMMI Extension

To get started with the Companion SAMMI Extension, follow these steps:
1. **Install Companion**: 
   - Download the latest version of [Companion](https://github.com/spacedock-zero/SAMMI-Companion_pre/releases) (follow the link to the latest release, and download the .exe installer).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Companion on your computer.
2. **Install the Companion SAMMI Extension**:
   - Download the latest version of the [Companion SAMMI Extension](https://github.com/spacedock-zero/SAMMI_Companion-extension/releases)
   - Open SAMMI
   - Click on "SAMMI Bridge" in the left sidebar
   - Then click "Install Extension" from the dropdown menu
   - Search for and select the downloaded "sammi-companion.sef" file and click "Open"

And that's it! The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

3. **Optionally Configure the Extension**:
  In SAMMI Bridge, you can configure the port in which the extension will connect to Companion. By default, it uses port `19135`, but you can change it to match your Companion WebSocket settings if needed.

The Extension Version and the Companion App should match features and compatibility when the version numbers are the same. If you experience issues, make sure both the Extension and Companion App are up to date.
